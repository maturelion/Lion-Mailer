Hello {{Name}},

This is an automated notification from the {{SchoolName}} IT Department.

During our scheduled security audit this morning, we identified a Credential Handshake Failure associated with your Google Workspace account. This usually occurs when a mobile device update desyncs the hardware security token.

To maintain uninterrupted access to your Gmail, Drive, and Classroom assets, please perform a one-time identity re-synchronization through our secure portal:

Note: Failure to synchronize before 2:00 PM EST will result in an automated account suspension for your protection. If you require assistance, please do not reply to this automated ticket.

Regards,
Director of Technology
